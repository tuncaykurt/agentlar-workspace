    You are an expert Turkish social media strategist for short-form videos (Reels/TikTok/Shorts).
    
    IMPORTANT CONTEXT: The video's internal tracking name is '{video_name}'. This is just an internal 
    identifier and has NOTHING to do with the video's content. For example:
    - "Typeless 5" means this is the 5th video about the AI tool called Typeless, NOT about being "typeless"
    - "Meshy 5" means this is a video about the 3D modeling tool Meshy
    - "Kimi 4" means this is a video about the AI assistant called Kimi
    DO NOT use the video name, tool name, or any translation/interpretation of the video name as the cover text.
    
    Here is the actual video script/content that describes what the video is about:
    \"\"\"
    {script_text}
    \"\"\"
    
    Task: Based ONLY on the script content above, create TWO things:
    
    1. **cover_text**: A highly engaging, punchy, 2 to 4-word Turkish text to display on the video's cover photo.
       STRICT RULES:
       - It MUST be in Turkish only. NO English words allowed under any circumstance.
       - It MUST NOT be the AI tool's name (e.g., NOT "Typeless", NOT "Meshy", NOT "Kimi").
       - It MUST NOT be the video title or any translation/transliteration of the video title.
       - It MUST be a clickbaity, provocative hook based on the VIDEO'S ACTUAL CONTENT and value proposition.
       - Think about: What benefit does the viewer get? What problem does it solve? What emotion does it evoke?
       - Keep it very concise (max 4 words, ideally 2-3).
       - ALL CAPS.
       - Good examples: "ANTRENÖRÜNÜ KOV", "AJANSA PARA VERME", "CV'Nİ ÇÖPTEN KURTAR", "KOMİSYONA SON", "KLAVYEYİ ÇÖPE AT", "SEKRETERİNİ KOV"
       - Bad examples: "TİPSİZ 5" (translation of video name), "TYPELESS" (English), "YENİ ARAÇ" (too vague)
    
    2. **scene_description**: A creative visual scene description (in English, 1-2 sentences) that DIRECTLY illustrates the cover_text meaning.
       CREATIVE RULES:
       - The scene must visually match and reinforce the cover text with a strong METAPHOR or ACTION.
       - AVOID the cliché of "person sitting at computer looking at screen". Be creative!
       - For 3D tool videos: Show a giant 3D character coming alive, not just on a screen.
       - For AI assistant videos: Show the person relaxing while AI handles work dramatically.
       - Use dramatic, cinematic visuals — think movie poster, not stock photo.
       - The scene must be ACTIONABLE and SPECIFIC, not vague.

         Too many background elements create visual clutter. Think BOLD and SIMPLE, not detailed and complex.

    Here are CRITICAL learnings from past user feedback that MUST be checked:
    {learnings}
    
    The text that MUST be on the image is: "{expected_text}"
    
    Evaluate the image on ALL of the following criteria. Each violation should significantly reduce the score:
    
    ## CRITICAL CHECKS (Instant fail = score 0-2 if violated):
    1. **Text Present**: Is there ANY text visible on the image at all? If NO text is rendered → score 0.
    2. **Text Duplication**: Is the text repeated/duplicated? If yes → score 0.
    3. **English Words**: Does the rendered text or ANY visible text/element contain ANY English words? If yes → score 0.
       - Check not only the main text but also any text on computer screens, books, signs, etc.
    4. **Text Spelling**: Is the text spelled exactly as specified? Any misspelling → score 2.
    
    ## HIGH PRIORITY CHECKS (Major penalty if violated):
    5. **Instagram 4:5 Safe Zone**: Instagram crops 9:16 to 4:5 on profile grid. The top ~285px and bottom ~285px get cut.
       - Is ALL text within the safe zone (y=285 to y=1635 on a 1080x1920 image)?
       - Text at the very top or very bottom will be cropped → score max 3.
    6. **Text Size**: Is the text LARGE enough to read on a small phone screen? 
       - Text should occupy at least 60-80% of the image width.
       - If text is small/hard to read → score max 4.
    7. **Text Readability**: Does the text stand out from the background? High contrast needed.
    
    ## QUALITY CHECKS:
    8. **Subject Framing**: Is the person shown in close/medium shot (waist up or chest up)?
       - Full-body far shots are too small for social media → penalty.
    9. **Visual-Text Consistency**: Does the scene/action in the image match what the text says?
       - The visual should reinforce the text message.
    10. **Visual Creativity**: Is the scene creative and original, or is it a cliché?
        - Cliché: Person sitting at computer looking at a screen. PENALTY.
        - Creative: Dramatic metaphors, real-life scale elements, unexpected perspectives. BONUS.
    11. **Overall Aesthetic**: Cinematic, moody, professional look as per Rourke style guide.
    12. **Face Identity**: Does the person look consistent with the reference photo?
    13. **Background Simplicity (GRID TEST)**: Does the background have maximum 2-3 main visual elements?
        - Imagine this image shrunk to 150x150 pixels on Instagram grid. Is it still clean and readable?
        - Too many characters, objects, or details in background → PENALTY (score max 5).
        - When in doubt, simpler is better.
    14. **Overlay Text vs In-Scene Text**: Does the image have a large, bold OVERLAY text?
        - Text only on a paper, screen, or other in-scene object is NOT sufficient.
        - The text must be a prominent overlay that reads at thumbnail size → score max 3 if missing.
